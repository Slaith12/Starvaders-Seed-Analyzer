# Starvaders Seed Analyzer
A program that predicts various random elements of a Starvaders run based on its seed.
Currently supports runs as any Gunner pilot with the current public demo.
Does not support combat analysis, although some basic functionality is planned (mainly initial deck order and spawn positions).

Comes with a basic console interface to look through any given seed, and the program can be customized to preform more complex analysis automatically.

## How to Run
Download the .zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Slaith12/Starvaders-Seed-Analyzer/releases), unzip, and run the .exe file within it. (This might not work on non-Windows computers)

Alternatively, you can download the repository and open the project in [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any similar IDE that supports C#.
