# Starvaders Seed Analyzer
A program that predicts various random elements of a Starvaders run based on its seed.
Currently supports runs as any Gunner pilot with the current public demo.
Does not support combat analysis, although some basic functionality is planned (mainly initial deck order and spawn positions).

Comes with a basic console interface to look through any given seed, and the program can be customized to preform more complex analysis automatically.

## How to Run
Open the project in [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or similar IDE to run the program.
